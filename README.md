# _Features_ ⬇️

- ### This project displays the use of Lazy-loading and the popular react-lazy-load-image-component.

- ### Almost 18mb images are loading in the initial rendering but you got the first paintful content in the first chance.

- ### All the images are loading one by one and images that are in other pages will not be loaded until you go to that page.

- ### The movies page will be fetched when you go to that page using pure lazy-loading.
